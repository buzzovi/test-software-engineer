# The Kaizen blog

Hi there! And welcome to the technical test stage of our interview process for becoming a Kaizen Software Engineer!

Normally at that point, you should already be aware of what will be expected from you over the next few hours.

So let's jump straight into it!

## Overview

We want you to create a web application that will be used as an "internal blog". The objective here is to let Kaizen staff members share updates and comment on those updates through a single-page web UI, as shown below:

![Example](https://github.com/KaizenReporting/test-software-engineer/blob/master/The%20Kaizen%20Blog.jpg?raw=true)

Users don't have to be authenticated. Anyone within the organisation can access this webapp and post updates and comments. They just have to enter their name and the message they want to post. (And optionally an image for blog posts if they want to)

Users can also delete comments. Again, it doesn't matter whether they posted the comment they want to delete or not, here any user is able to delete any comment, there is no concept of authentication. However, what we'll want in a situation where a comment is deleted, is to send an email to alert administrators about it.

Below is the full list of requirements. We recommend you to start by documenting the technical architecture you plan on implementing before doing any actual work. (Last section of this document)

## Constraints

## Technical architecture

Please replace the text in this section with a short paragraph detailing how you will be architecting the solution. Which services you are going to use, why you think that they're the most appropriate and how they interact with each other. We're not looking for a fully detailed technical documentation here, but at least something that quickly enables us (and other developers) to understand what you've done and how.

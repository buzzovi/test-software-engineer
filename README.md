# The Kaizen blog

Hi there! And welcome to the technical test stage of our interview process for becoming a Kaizen Software Engineer!

Normally at that point, you should already be aware of what will be expected from you over the next few hours.

## Constraints

## Technical architecture

Please replace the text in this section with a short paragraph detailing how you will be architecting the solution. Which services you are going to use, why you think that they're the most appropriate and how they interact with each other. We're not looking for a fully detailed technical documentation here, but at least something that quickly enables us (and other developers) to understand what you've done and how.
